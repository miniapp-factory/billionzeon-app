+Code the following app
+```
+A slot machine with 3 columns and 3 rows, each slot contains one fruit. The fruits should be: Apple, Banana, Cherry, Lemon. Generate an vector style image with white background for each fruit and use it to display that fruit. The fruits should be spawned by the machine at random. The user can press the spin button, which will trigger a spinning animation that moves the columns downward, spawning new fruit at the top repeatedly for 2 seconds. If there are 3 of the same fruit in any row or column at any time while not spinning, display a win message to the user, which they can share on their feed. Check the win condition directly using a conditional render instead of calculating it in a function. The user should always be able to spin again, except while the spinning animation is in progress.
+
+Place the slot machine to the home page.
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.

+Design a high-end online multiplayer first-person shooter (FPS) with AAA-level ultra-realistic graphics set in a near-future sci-fi world (year 2087). The Earth is divided between two rival factions: the technocratic 'Neo-Alliance' and the mercenary-led 'Iron Syndicate'. The game features dynamic weather systems, real-time ray-traced lighting, 8K textures, and motion-captured character animations. Players choose from four distinct tactical classes—Assault, Recon, Support, and Infiltrator—each with unique abilities and modular weapon customization. Maps include futuristic urban environments like Neo-Tokyo megacity, orbital space stations, and post-war Siberian ruins. Gameplay emphasizes competitive 5v5 matches with realistic ballistics, weapon recoil physics, and optional VR support.
